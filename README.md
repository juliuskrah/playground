## Python Interview Questions
Mr. Zac is the new manager of the Wolff International Bank. He has requested that a new banking system be deployed.  
You have been assigned the task of developing a new banking system software for the client.

With reference to Python Object Oriented Programming:

1. Design a core banking system software that meets Mr. Zac's requirements. Create the following classes for the bank:
  * Bank Class
  * eServices Class
  
2. **Bank Class**  
Using functions, your software should perform basic banking functions like:
  * Allowing tellers to view customer details (customer name, customer account number, customer phone number, customer address)
  * The banking system should be able to accept debit & credit transactions on any account.
  
3. Create a function that writes each account created to a file. The prefix of the profile should be the account number and the extension, **"wolff"**. Eg. **11231001.wolff**

4. **eServices Class**  
Create a class called eServices then create an eService Type (e.g. Mobile Banking). Every customer should be able to access any eService Type.
